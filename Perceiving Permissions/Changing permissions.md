# Changing permissions
In this we learnt how to change the permissions of a certain file using the chmod (change mode) command. In this we had to change the permission so that the hacker user can also
read the /flag file.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ chmod go+r *
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wHD1GkR1Mq2ecMEFI1cnq-Q2I5P.dNzNyUDLxcDN0czW}
