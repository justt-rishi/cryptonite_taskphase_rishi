# Intro To Arguments
I learnt what an argument(additional data passed to the command) is and learnt how to invoke it.
# Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0HlZqEIz1Flgc9kCT3HzTwdbiwU.dhjNyUDLxcDN0czW}
```
Here hello is the command and hackers is the argument.
