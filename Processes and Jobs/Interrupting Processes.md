# Interrupting Processes
In this challenge we learnt how to use ctrl+c to interrupt a process. We had to interup /challenge/run to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AaAim20rfhB7LBKgOiq7Wd8KvT9.dNDN4QDLxcDN0czW}
