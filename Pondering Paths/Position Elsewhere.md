# Position Elsewhere
In this Challenge we got more practice on using the cd command to navigate around the directories. In this specific challenge we were required to move to the /tmp directory to 
find the file.
```
Connected!
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /tmp directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
