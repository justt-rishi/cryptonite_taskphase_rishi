# Program and Absolute Paths
In this challenge, we learned more about paths etc. (root directories and all). 
It was given that the challenges in pwn college were in the challenge directory, and this directory was right in the root directory (/).
Basically, by the end, we had to invoke the run part of the whole setup by invoking /challenge/run.
# Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gkQky550UvyXcqO3kA3YUyRa6ix.dVDN1QDLxcDN0czW}
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$
