# Position Thy Self
In this challenge I learnt about the cd (Change Directory) commamd in linux which helps us navigate throught the different directories present on linux. 
This helps us find the flag when we are in the right directory. To finsh the challenge we have to run the /challenge/run command from the right directory.
