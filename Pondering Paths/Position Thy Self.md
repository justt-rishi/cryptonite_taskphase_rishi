# Position Thy Self
In this challenge I learnt about the cd (Change Directory) commamd in linux which helps us navigate throught the different directories present on linux. 
This helps us find the flag when we are in the right directory. To finsh the challenge we have to run the /challenge/run command from the right directory.
# Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wEJrDmUEB6ujbSPiuU3El4E-LW0.dZDN1QDLxcDN0czW}
