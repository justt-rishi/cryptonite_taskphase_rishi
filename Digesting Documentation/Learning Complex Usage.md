# Learning Complex Usage
In this challenge we learnt how to use the --printfile argument which is used to print a certain file in any directory. Here we had to print the /flag file from /challenge/challenge
to get the flag using --printfile.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
