# making directories
In this challenge we were taught how to make directories using the mkdir command in linux. We were asked to make a /tmp/pwn directory and make a challenge file in it. After doing
so we had to run the /challenge/run command to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EopBKyN0JWxZgc6ZYR9lsd1dqP0.dFzM4QDLxcDN0czW}
