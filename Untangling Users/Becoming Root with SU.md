# Becoming root with su
In this we learnt how a password works when we use the su command (switch user). The password was hack-the-planet. But the password not visible when we type lmao.....had to do it
blindly.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password:
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat /flag
pwn.college{8hnslLUqUbpAVXqPUrWK-I8PZLf.dVTN0UDLxcDN0czW}
