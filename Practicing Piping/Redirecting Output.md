# Redirecting Output
In this challenge we learnt how to redirect a command to a file. For example, here in this challenge we were required input redirection to write the word PWN to the filename 
COLLEGE. It can easily be done by using this charecter '>'.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{wsT1S8VuybmDLe-DPEkjPPAbWRf.dRjN1QDLxcDN0czW}
```
