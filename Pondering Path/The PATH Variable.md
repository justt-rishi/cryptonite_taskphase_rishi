# The PATH Variable
In this we learnt how there is a PATH variable which hold all the commands such as ls, rm etc etc. We had to clear out the rm commant by deleting everything the PATH variable to
get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ ls
COLLEGE  PWN  instructions  myflag        not-the-flag1  script.sh  the-flag  x.sh
Desktop  b    leap          not-the-flag  output.txt     tee        x.h
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=""
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
