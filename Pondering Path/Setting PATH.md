In this challenge the syntax to rewrite the PATH variabele. Here we had to rewrite the PATH properly so that win command will run properly through /challenge/run command like
shown below.
## Command Line

hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run win
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
