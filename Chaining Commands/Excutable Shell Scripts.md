# Excutable Shell Scripts
In this challenge we had to make a shell script and make it invoke the /challenge/solve command. Then we make the shell script excutable and then run the script file using a 
relative path to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ nano script.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ chmod +x script.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./script.sh
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:
pwn.college{Un-5wXbgJ8sEfv538iaD3TMENP1.dRzNyUDLxcDN0czW}
