# Your First Script Shell
In this we had to create a shell script and append the /challenge/pwn and the /challenge/run into the x.sh shell script. I had to research on how to write a script shell. I did is
using the nano command like below:-
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ chmod a+x x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
