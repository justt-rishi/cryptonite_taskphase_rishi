# Chaining using ;
In this we learned how to chain commands using the semicolon. We had to chain /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{csWzhRhl6u0Mzs9UFzBOqodGVCD.dVTN4QDLxcDN0czW}
```
