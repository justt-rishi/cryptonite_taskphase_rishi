# Reading Input
In this challenge we learnt how to read an input value given by the user and then assign it to a variable. Here we had to take the input COLLEGE from the user and store it in
PWN using the read command to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p ">" PWN
>COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{w5E26QCCaMON_z4RJiPmc16Meq3.dhzN1QDLxcDN0czW}
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$
```
