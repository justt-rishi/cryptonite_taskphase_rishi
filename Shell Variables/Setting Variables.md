# Setting Variables
In this challenge we leared how to set variable to a value or string. Like in any other syntax we had to use the = symbol with no spaces before or after the symbol. In this 
specific challenge we had to set PWN to the value to COLLEGE (case sensitive) to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{8O-amRGhroJCALZSVMaOiCp7hVA.dlTN1QDLxcDN0czW}
```
