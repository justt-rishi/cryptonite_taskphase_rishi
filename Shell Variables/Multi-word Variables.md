# Multi-word Variables
This challenge is an add on to the previous one. We basically learned how to set variables with values which include a space charecter. Here, we had to set PWN to COLLEGE YEAH.
This can be done using the quotation marks.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{gLtm-1Hk7PNPinY-3Fud1Z47U-j.dBjN1QDLxcDN0czW}
```
