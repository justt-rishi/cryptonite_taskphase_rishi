# Reading Files
In this challenge we learnt how to read files by piping them into the variable using the read command. In this specific one we were required to read /challenge/read_me into
the PWN environment variable to get the flag.
## Command Line
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Ij9M572oK4rX1JA55PAPeJTK3jl.dBjM4QDLxcDN0czW}
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$
```
